<h1>This page explains how PROMISES work.</h1>

<p>A promise is are like a funcation in that they run then wait for either the call to be fulfilled and the "then()" statement runs or be rejected and the "catch()" statement runs.  </p>
<p>It is a function that is waiting on some type of input to run. It handles asynchronous things.</p>
<p>This is helpful when fetching info from APIs</p>
